# ðŸ“Š Balance Sheet â€“ CSS Pseudo Selectors Project

This project was completed as part of the **"Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet"** course from [freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jfcosta/responsive-web-design). It focuses on using CSS pseudo selectors to style specific HTML elements and create interactive effects.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

CSS pseudo selectors allow developers to target elements based on their state, position, or relationship to other elements. In this project, I built a balance sheet layout and used pseudo selectors to:

- Style elements on hover  
- Highlight specific rows or columns  
- Trigger visual changes based on user interaction  
- Apply consistent formatting to grouped elements

The project demonstrates how pseudo selectors enhance user experience and improve visual clarity without relying on JavaScript.
