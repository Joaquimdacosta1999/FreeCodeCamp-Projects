# â™¿ Accessible Quiz â€“ HTML & Accessibility Project

This project was completed as part of the **"Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz"** course from [freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jfcosta/responsive-web-design). It focuses on building a quiz webpage that is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Accessibility ensures that web content is usable by everyone, regardless of ability. In this project, I built a quiz interface using:

- Semantic HTML for structure and clarity  
- ARIA attributes to enhance screen reader support  
- Keyboard navigation for non-mouse users  
- Design best practices for readability and usability

The goal was to create an inclusive experience that meets accessibility standards while maintaining functionality and clarity.
