## 📖 About This Course

CSS tells the browser how to display your webpage. You can use CSS to control:

- 🎨 Colors  
- 🔤 Fonts  
- 📏 Sizes

In this course, I learned the basics of CSS by designing a **menu page for a cafe**, applying styles to headings, lists, and containers to create a clean and appealing layout.
