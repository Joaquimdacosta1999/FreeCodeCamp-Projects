## 📖 Project Overview

Flexbox is a powerful layout tool in CSS that allows developers to create flexible and responsive designs. In this project, I built a photo gallery using:

- Semantic HTML to structure the page  
- CSS Flexbox to arrange images in a responsive grid  
- Media queries to ensure the layout adjusts across devices  
- Clean and maintainable code for future enhancements

This project demonstrates how Flexbox simplifies layout challenges and improves user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
