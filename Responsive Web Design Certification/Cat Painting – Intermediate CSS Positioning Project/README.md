# 🐱 Cat Painting – Intermediate CSS Positioning Project

This project was completed as part of the **"Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Cat Painting"** course from [freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jfcosta/responsive-web-design). It focuses on mastering CSS positioning techniques by building a stylized cat painting using HTML and CSS.

## 📖 Project Overview

Positioning elements precisely is essential for creating visually engaging and responsive layouts. In this project, I used:

- **Absolute positioning** to place elements exactly where needed  
- **Z-index** to layer components and control stacking order  
- **Transform** to rotate, scale, and shift elements for artistic effect  
- Semantic HTML to structure the painting canvas

The final result is a playful, abstract cat painting composed entirely of HTML elements styled with CSS.
