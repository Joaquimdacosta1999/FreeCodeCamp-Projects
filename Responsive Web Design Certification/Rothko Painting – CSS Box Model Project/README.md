# 🖼️ Rothko Painting – CSS Box Model Project

This project was completed as part of the **"Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting"** course from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jfcosta/responsive-web-design). It focuses on understanding how the CSS Box Model works by creating abstract, rectangular art inspired by Mark Rothko.

## 📖 Project Overview

Every HTML element is its own box—with spacing, padding, borders, and margins. This concept is known as the **CSS Box Model**, and it's foundational to layout and design in web development.

In this project, I used:

- HTML to structure the page  
- CSS to apply box model properties  
- Rectangular elements to mimic Rothko-style paintings  
- Padding, margin, and border techniques to control spacing and composition

The project is a creative way to explore layout behavior and how boxes interact with each other visually.
