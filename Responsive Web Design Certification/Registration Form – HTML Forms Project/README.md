# 📝 Registration Form – HTML Forms Project

This project was completed as part of the **"Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form"** course from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jfcosta/responsive-web-design). It focuses on building a functional signup page using HTML form elements and introduces basic CSS tools for styling.

## 📖 Project Overview

HTML forms are essential for collecting user input on websites. In this project, I built a registration form that includes:

- Input fields for name, email, password, and other details  
- Form validation using HTML attributes  
- Semantic structure for accessibility  
- Basic CSS styling to enhance usability and layout

The project emphasizes how to control the types of data users can enter and how to structure forms for clarity and accessibility.
