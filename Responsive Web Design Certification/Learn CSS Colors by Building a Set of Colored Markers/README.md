Selecting the correct colors for your webpage can greatly improve its aesthetic appeal and readability. In this course, I learned how to:

- Pair colors for visual harmony  
- Use semantic and accessible color choices  
- Style elements to resemble a set of colored markers

The project involved building a simple layout that visually represents colored markers, using CSS to define their appearance and distinguish them by hue.
