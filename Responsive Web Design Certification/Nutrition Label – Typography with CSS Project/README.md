# ðŸ§¾ Nutrition Label â€“ Typography with CSS Project

This project was completed as part of the **"Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label"** course from [freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jfcosta/responsive-web-design). It focuses on using CSS typography techniques to create a readable, structured nutrition label layout.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Typography is the art of styling text to be readable, purposeful, and visually balanced. In this project, I built a nutrition label webpage using:

- Semantic HTML to structure the label  
- CSS to style text, adjust line height, and control spacing  
- Font weight, size, and alignment to mimic real-world packaging  
- Layout techniques to position text precisely

This project demonstrates how thoughtful typography improves clarity and user experience, even in utilitarian designs like nutrition labels.
