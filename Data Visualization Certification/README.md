# 📊 Data Visualization Certification

Welcome to the **Data Visualization Certification** repository! This project showcases the achievements of **Joaquim Costa**, who successfully completed all coursework and certification projects from freeCodeCamp’s Data Visualization curriculum. Every challenge and project was completed, demonstrating proficiency in D3.js, JSON, APIs, and dynamic data presentation.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

This certification focuses on turning raw data into meaningful visual stories using:

- **D3.js (Data Driven Documents)** – a powerful JavaScript library for creating interactive visualizations  
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** – a lightweight data format for APIs  
- **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)** – for fetching and loading data dynamically

You'll learn how to build charts, graphs, and maps that respond to user interaction and display complex datasets in intuitive ways.
